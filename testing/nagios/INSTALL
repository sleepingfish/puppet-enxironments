INSTALLATION

PRE-REQUISITES

Puppet versions at least 2.7 required on all nodes, at least because the $::osfamily facter variable is used.

Nagios3 server is recommended, which is what you'll get on RH6 or Ubuntu12, and a variety of gotchas occur with nagio2 server. no subhostgroups, bad apache file, perhaps others.

Nagios client and nrpe versions should hopefully be flexible to support older clients.

First, install puppet server.  Add storeconfig functionality with a DB backend so that exported resources work.  Google storeconfig for more details.

Assign fully qualified hostnames to the puppet nodes and puppet server and make sure they are either in DNS, or in /etc/hosts, on all nodes.

#install puppet client

#redhat
(check iptables.  this module won't punch a hole in iptables yet for usage of nrpe and nagios.)

su -c 'rpm -ivh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-7.noarch.rpm'
#or similar...

yum install puppet

#ubuntu:
#on client:
apt-get install puppet
vi /etc/defaults/puppet

#on both OS's
add to /etc/hosts the IP of puppet server
x.x.x.x puppet

#on client:
puppetd --waitforcert 30 --server puppet -v

#on server
puppetca --list
puppetca --sign

#to allow puppet kick from the server, add auth.conf and the agent section in puppet.conf.

DONE WITH PREREQUISITES

MAIN INSTRUCTIONS

#create site.pp with at least something like this.

node basenode {
        include nagios::target
}

#host1 will be nagios server
node 'host1.ec2.internal' inherits basenode {
        include nagios
        }

#host2 and others will be nagios clients
node 'host2.ec2.internal' inherits basenode {}

--------------

apply the puppet modules to the nodes with puppet kick or puppet agent.

Connect to the new nagios server at http://servername/nagios

username: nagiosadmin
password: nagiosadmin

You can change the password by using htpasswd on the passwd file (run locate passwd to find it)

=======================

Example: To get a service to work, use this syntax on a target node in site.pp

nagios::service::http {test:}

Notice in this example that it doesn't use the keyword "include".  It is just calling a resource.

To add basic nagios entries, put them into the defaults directory in the nagios module.

Take a look at docs/README.orig for more information.   That was from the code that this was based on.
