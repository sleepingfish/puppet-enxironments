Introduction/Notes
=====================

This is a complete nagios puppet implementation that works right out of the box.   It should support Redhat based servers such as Centos, and Debian based servers such as Ubuntu.   Both the client ( nrpe ) and the server. 

Doesn't that sound grand?

I strongly encourage users to send me bug fixes or just write to say they are using the module.  This module is very new.   It could be categorized as a BETA VERSION until I get feedback.

See the INSTALL file for installation details.

See the docs/README.orig file for more information.

Thanks,
Sam
